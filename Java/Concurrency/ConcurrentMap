ConcurrentMap represents map which is capable of handling concurrent get and put operation.

ConcurrentHashMap:
  ConcurrentHashMap is very similar to HashTable excepts it does better concurrency than HashTable.
  ConcurrentHashMap does not lock whole map while reading and writing.
  It only locks part of it while writing.
