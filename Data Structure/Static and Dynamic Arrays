What is static Array?
  Fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n-1].
  Each slot in array can be referenced with a number means "indexable".

  Static arrays are given as continues chunk of Memory.All the addresses are adjacent in static array.

  Complexity:

  Operation           Best    Worst
  Access              O(1)    O(1)      Access using index
  Search              O(n)    O(n)
  Insertion           N/A     O(n)      Need to reshuffle all array to insert (dynamic array)
  Appending           N/A     O(1)
  Deletion            N/A     O(n)      Reshuffle again



  Dynamic Arrays can grow and shrink in size.
  We can add elements in the dynamic array it will grow in size.

  We need to implement dynamic array using static arrays

  Steps:
  1. Create a static array with an initial capacity.
  2. Add elements to the underlying static array, keep track of number of elements.
  3. If adding another element exceeds the capacity, then create a new static array with twice the capacity
     and copy the original elements into it and add the new element we want to add.
