What is Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant messaging system which enables communication between producers and consumers using message-based topics.
In simple words, it designs a platform for high-end new generation distributed applications.

Also, it allows a large number of permanent or ad-hoc consumers. One of the best features of Kafka is, it is highly available and resilient to node failures and supports automatic recovery.
 This feature makes Apache Kafka ideal for communication and integration between components of large-scale data systems in real-world data systems.
