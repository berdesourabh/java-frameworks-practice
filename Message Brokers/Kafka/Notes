What is Kafka?
Kafka is a distributed log.
Apache Kafka is a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant messaging system which enables communication between producers and consumers using message-based topics.
In simple words, it designs a platform for high-end new generation distributed applications.

Also, it allows a large number of permanent or ad-hoc consumers. One of the best features of Kafka is, it is highly available and resilient to node failures and supports automatic recovery.
 This feature makes Apache Kafka ideal for communication and integration between components of large-scale data systems in real-world data systems.


Everything is basically for records and messages.
Every message you send will append to the topic.
This topic will be append only.
Topic is immutable.

Topic, Partitions, Segments:

Topic is consists of multiple Partitions.
Number of Partitions will decide how many consumers you can have.
Partitions have multiple segments.
