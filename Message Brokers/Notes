  3.That means both sender and receiver are loosely coupled and don't need to be online all time to communicate.

Why need message broker?
    Basically, message brokers used for.
    To ensure loosely coupling between producer and consumer.
    To maintain asynchronous/ non-blocking communication between producer and consumer.
    In case consumer cannot process messages as fast as producer sending. (Messages can be buffered in queue)

    Server publishes their messages to some specific topic inside broker and if client subscribes that particular topic client receives messages that published by the server.
    The reverse is also possible. Messages bodies can be a different format (JSON, XML, text, binary etc.).
